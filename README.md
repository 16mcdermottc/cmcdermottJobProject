# cmcdermottJobProject
Senior Design and Development - Sprint 2

## Christian McDermott
- This program takes from the GitHub Jobs API and stores them into a SQLite DB
- Six tests are built into the project
- The 1st test checks to see if at least 100 jobs are taken in from the API
- The 2nd test checks the DB to make sure at least 1 known company is listed
- The 3rd test checks to make sure the DB exists
- The 4th and 5th tests give good and bad data to make sure the functions run properly
- The 6th test makes sure there are no NULL primary keys in the DB
- To run tests, use command 'python -m pytest'
